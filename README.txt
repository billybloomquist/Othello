We contributed pretty equally over last two weeks.  We both worked on the
initial code base, Billy looked over Patrick's shoulder as Patrick typed out
the code.  Billy wrote the getScore for the heuristic, and Patrick ended up 
modifying the getMove to look one move ahead.

We have it always looking two moves ahead, hoping to get a jump start at the
early game.  Some ideas that we toyed around with included making it search
less in the early game to save computation time when we really need it in the
late game.
